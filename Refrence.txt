Shame Free

Learn about Jewish practices from
the comfort of your couch, without
feeling ignorant or embarrassed

The Judaism journey
that sparks joy

Our mission: To make learning the whats, whys, and hows of
Jewish practice a joyous, safe, and non-intimidating process.
We envision a world where no Jew ever has to ask “Where
do | begin?” or “How?” or “Now what?”

Where every Jew, everywhere, knows that education,
guidance, and practical implementation are only a click away.

Once upon a time, learning how to practice Judaism
was a frustrating, confusing experience.

Countless calls to your rabbi ‘cause
your religious level is constantly
changing and you have new
questions

Text-heavy books filled

with WAY too much info

about Jewish laws, customs, and
concepts

Overwhelming, hard-to-navigate
websites that seem to cover
everything except what you came
there to learn.

Time-consuming trips to the local
Judaica store (if you're lucky
enough to live near one)

to find the things you need.

At Jewit, we're
changing that.

We believe it's about time that Jewish learning
caught up to the 21st century.

We love bagels, rabbi jokes, and doing mitzvot,

but above all, we're passionate about making it
simple for you to learn how to Jew it.

Learn. Shop. Do. Jew.

Built for millennials

Why should a Jewish site look like a stuffy
lecturer and a character from Fiddler on
the Roof met up in a bar on the web?
Jewltis like the cool older sibling who

real-time answers, and online shopping?

No judgments

You know Judaism welcomes questions,
but sometimes you're ashamed to ask.
Jewlt gives you the opportunity to search
for answers, ask rabbis, and learn about
Jewish practices without feeling self-
conscious or uncomfortable.

Respect for your journey

We're not affiliated with any specific
organization or branch of Judaism. There
are many different ways to be Torah
observant, and we respect and
encourage them all. We'll show you a
variety of traditions and customs so YOU

can find YOUR path.
Legit links
You need a menorah. Or a mezuzah.
Or tefillin. But shopping online makes you
nervous. Is ita scam? Are you buying the p—
“kosher” one? With Jewlt, you know PR
you're getting guidance and products (— — =)
from trustworthy rabbis.
Your one-stop shop

There are sites that teach about Judaism,
sites that provide live answers to
questions, and sites that sell Jewish
products. A site that combines all of the
above? Mazal tov, you're in luck! (Hint: It
starts with a J and rhymes with “do-it”

So, what are you
waiting for?

About the founder

Rabbi Shmuel Bristritzky is a highly-respected spiritual leader
and educator. As the Rabbi of Chabad of Savyon, he has
devoted his life to sharing his knowledge and passion for
Jewish traditions and practices. He is the author of the popular
series of beginner's guides on Jewish practices, Yahaduton,
which have been translated into English and French.

The success of Yahaduton further emphasized the importance
of accessible, easy-to-digest education on Jewish practice,
and Rabbi Bristritzky understood that digital media was the
best way to ensure that this valuable content could be
accessed by a vastly wider audience. This inspired him to
create Jewlt, a platform aimed at educating and empowering
individuals in the Jewish community and beyond to observe
Jewish life with confidence and joy.
